# IaC-EDR-Backend

> **Note:**
> If you’re on a brand new Ubuntu system, you may need to install `git` first:
> ```sh
> sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git

This repository provides an automated, reproducible Ansible-based deployment for an EDR (Elasticsearch, Kibana, TheHive) backend stack. It is designed for academic, research, and production use, following best practices for infrastructure as code (IaC).

---

## ✨ Features
- **One-command deployment**: Run `./deploy.sh` to provision a full EDR backend stack.
- **Prerequisite checks**: Script verifies Python 3, Ansible, sshpass, and openssl are installed, and prints install instructions if not.
- **SSH key automation**: Prompts to generate and copy SSH keys for passwordless, secure automation.
- **Ansible Vault integration**: Sensitive variables are encrypted automatically.
- **User-friendly prompts**: Clear, step-by-step guidance for all required inputs.
- **Post-deployment health checks**: Script checks Kibana and TheHive endpoints and prints their status.
- **Security best practices**: Encourages SSH key use, vault secrets, and firewall rules.
- **Academic/professional documentation**: README and structure suitable for final year project submission.

## 🚦 Quick Start Guide (for ANYONE)

**1. (If needed) Install git**
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git
```

**2. Clone the repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/klargdev/IaC-ERD-Backend.git
cd IaC-EDR-Backend
```
> If you prefer SSH and have set up your GitHub SSH key, you can use:
> `git clone git@github.com:klargdev/IaC-ERD-Backend.git`

**3. Install prerequisites**
```sh
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip ansible sshpass openssl
```

**4. Make the deploy script executable**
```sh
chmod +x deploy.sh
```

**5. Run the magic!**
```sh
./deploy.sh
```

**6. Follow the prompts:**
- If you don’t have an SSH key, the script will help you create one.
- Enter your backend server’s IP, SSH username, and password.
- The script can copy your SSH key to the backend for passwordless access.
- Sit back and watch as your EDR backend is provisioned and configured!

**7. When it’s done:**
- Access Kibana: `http://<your-server-ip>:5601`
- Access TheHive: `http://<your-server-ip>:9000`
- Get Elastic credentials: `sudo cat /etc/elasticsearch/passwords` (on the backend server)

## 🪄 How it Works (Behind the Magic)
1. **Checks your system:** Ensures all required tools are installed.
2. **Handles SSH keys:** Generates and/or copies them for secure, passwordless automation.
3. **Initializes secrets:** Creates an Ansible Vault password for encrypting sensitive variables.
4. **Prompts for your backend server info:** IP, username, password.
5. **Writes inventory and variables:** Sets up Ansible’s inventory and group variables for your environment.
6. **Encrypts secrets:** Uses Ansible Vault to protect sensitive data.
7. **Runs the Ansible playbook:** Provisions and configures Elasticsearch, Kibana, and TheHive on your backend server.
8. **Checks service health:** Verifies Kibana and TheHive are up and running.
9. **Prints access info:** Tells you where to find your dashboards and credentials.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: The script says a package is missing!**
- A: Copy the install command it prints and run it, then re-run `./deploy.sh`.

**Q: SSH key copy fails or asks for password every time.**
- A: Make sure the backend server allows SSH from your control node. Try copying the key manually:
  ```sh
  ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub <user>@<backend-ip>
  ```

**Q: Playbook fails with permission errors.**
- A: Ensure your backend user has sudo privileges.

**Q: Kibana or TheHive health check says [WARN].**
- A: Wait a minute and try again, or check the backend server logs for errors.

**Q: How do I reset/redeploy?**
- A: You can re-run `./deploy.sh` as many times as you like. It will overwrite inventory and variables as needed.

**Q: Can I customize versions or settings?**
- A: Edit `group_vars/edr_backend.yml` before running the script, or after (then re-encrypt with Ansible Vault).

**Q: Is it safe to commit my secrets?**
- A: Never commit `vault/.vault_pass` or any real secrets. The repo’s `.gitignore` helps protect you.

## 📚 Academic Implementation Requirements

This project was designed to meet the following baseline requirements for an Ansible control node and EDR backend provisioning:

### 3.3.1 Ansible Control Node Requirements

1. **Operating System:**
   - Ubuntu Server LTS (22.04) is recommended for the control node for stability and support.
2. **Required Packages:**
   - The control node should have Python 3, pip, ansible, sshpass, and openssl installed to enable secure SSH, encrypted variable management, and role-based execution.
3. **Network and Connectivity:**
   - SSH key pairs should be generated and securely stored on the control node for passwordless, encrypted SSH connections to the backend server. Keys are distributed only to the backend server at this stage.
4. **Backend Server Provisioning:**
   - The backend EDR server should be deployed in an isolated lab environment with a static private IP. Firewall rules should restrict SSH access to only the control node’s IP.
5. **Privileges and Security:**
   - The backend server must accept SSH connections with sudo privileges, allowing Ansible to perform privileged tasks (e.g., package installation, upgrades, configuration changes).
6. **Sensitive Data Management:**
   - Ansible Vault is used to encrypt sensitive variables, SSH keys, and API tokens. TLS/SSL certificates are included in roles to secure Elasticsearch and Kibana communications (HTTPS enforced).
7. **Playbook Structure:**
   - The project uses a master playbook (`site.yml`) and modular roles:
     - `roles/elasticsearch`: Elasticsearch install, GPG key, repo, systemd, TLS certs
     - `roles/kibana`: Kibana install, config, reverse proxy (if needed), HTTPS
     - `roles/thehive`: TheHive deploy, config, DB init, web interface test
8. **Version Control and Reproducibility:**
   - All playbooks, inventory, and encrypted variable files are version-controlled for traceability and reproducibility.

```

---

## ⚠️ Security Notes
- **Never commit `vault/.vault_pass` or any real secrets to version control.**
- The vault password is generated per run and stored locally for Ansible Vault operations.
- Use SSH keys for secure, passwordless access between control node and backend server.
- Restrict backend server SSH access to only the control node’s IP via firewall rules.

## 📝 Customization
- Edit `group_vars/edr_backend.yml` before running the script, or after (then re-encrypt with Ansible Vault).
- Extend roles in `roles/` to add handlers, templates, or additional configuration as needed.
- Add your own TLS/SSL certificates to the appropriate roles for HTTPS enforcement.

## 📋 Requirements
- Ansible must be installed on the machine running `deploy.sh`.
- Target server(s) must be Ubuntu-based and accessible via SSH.
- SSH key-based authentication is strongly recommended for security and automation.

**Happy automating!**
